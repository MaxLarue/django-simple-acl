        django-simple-acl
        ==================
        
        Configuring builtin groups and permissions declaratively from code as static access control lists. Integrates with
         django built-in model permissions
        
        Features:
        
        - Define a list of groups that should exist at all time
        - Bind to each group a set of crud permissions to any model

        Usage
        =====
        
        With django-simple-acls you define the groups of users you need in your app, which CRUD permission each group brings to
        the user and on application startup the groups are created and model permissions are linked.
        
        Everything happens at startup and the final state is dictated by your code, which makes it simple to configure, update
        and replicate in multiple deployments.
        
        To setup django-simple-acls, you must define a SIMPLE_ACL dictionary inside your settings.py file. Entries are:
            - groups: a list of string representing the groups names
            - acls: a list of path to the acls objects
        
        `acls` is a list of path such as those of middleware in the form "path.to.module.objectinsidethemodule". The goal here
        is to have acls live inside the same module as the model they apply on.
        
        An example SIMPLE_ACL config can be found inside the test source:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            SIMPLE_ACLS = {
                "groups": [DRIVER, SHOP_EMPLOYEE, SALESMAN, ACCOUNTANT, MANAGER],
                "acls": [
                    "testautoload.acls.ACLS"
                ]
            }
        
        where DRIVER, SHOP_EMPLOYEE, SALESMAN, ACCOUNTANT and MANAGER are actually the group name (as a string).
        
        The acl declaration structure in itself can be as follow:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from myapp.models import MyCoolModel
            from myapp.groups import ANONYMOUS, USER, ADMIN
            from simpleacls.acls import C, R, U, D
        
            ACLS = {
                MyCoolModel: {
                    ANONYMOUS: {R}
                    USER: {C, R, U},
                    ADMIN: {C, R, U, D}
                }
            }
        
        In other words, acl declarations are a mapping of models, to groups, to permissions.
        
        C, R, U, D are create, read, update delete permissions on a certain model.
        
        The model itself is the key in the ACLS mapping (not his name, the actual model class).
        
        On this model we define a map of groups and for each groups, which permission is available.
        
        Permissions are a set of C, R, U, D.
        
        The group key is actually the group name (if you have a group called admin, it would be 'admin'). But you'll probably
        want to maje these constants in your project or an enum.
        
        If you omit a group for a model, that group will have no permission on that model.
        
        If you define two sets of permissions for the same group, on the same model, they will be merged and duplicates removed.
        (meaning if you define two sets of permission, the resulting permission set will be the highest combination of both)
        
        .. _gotchas:
        
        Gotchas
        ========
        
            - If the groups are not created and the permissions not linked on startup, maje sure you added 'simpleacls.apps.SimpleAclsConfig' to your installed apps
            - If you omit the SIMPLE_ACLS settings or make a typo in the name, no permission will be loaded
            - If you need to define an empty set of permissions use `set()` as `{}` is an empty dictionary.
            - If the acl path in SIMPLE_ACLS["acl"] is not valid (module does not exist or does not have the specified object). Then your application won't start (but you should see a warning about it).
            - In order for permissions to be loaded inside your tests, you need to use the AclTestMixin (see the test section for detail).
        
        .. _testing:
        
        Testing
        ========
        
        The groups and permissions might not be setup correctly during your test (but they will be on application start). To
        avoid confusion, and make sure everything is setup correctly, you should use the AclTestMixin in your integration/end2end
        tests. Here is an example how to:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from django.test import TestCase
            from simpleacls.testutils import AclTestMxin
        
            class MyTest(AclTestMixin, TestCase):
        
                def test_something(self):
                    some = Group.objects.get(name="some_groups")  # this group and it's permissions were created
        
        .. _restframework:
        
        Usage with rest framework
        ==========================
        
        The fact permissions used are the django's models one makes it possible to use this package with any other package that
        integrate with those. As an example to leverage these permissions on a drf viewset, you'd use the DjangoModelPermissions
        class and you're set:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from rest_framework import viewsets
            from rest_framework.permissions import DjangoModelPermissions
            from myapp.models import MyCoolModel
            from myapp.serializers import MyCoolModelSerializer
        
            class CoolModelViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
                queryset = MyCoolModel.objects.all()
                serializer_class = MyCoolModelSerializer
                permission_classes = [DjangoModelPermissions]
        
        
        This viewset will respect your acls, as the permissions live inside the database and are created upon startup.
